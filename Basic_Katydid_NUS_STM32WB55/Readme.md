Simple sketch to demonstrate Katydid board function with no module attached. 
Includes detecting wake-on-motion/sleep-on-no-motion with the on-board BMA400, checking the ID and capacity of the on-board 16 MByte QSPI flash,
blinking the led, measuring STm32WB55 MCU temperature and battery voltage and reporting the same at intervals via BLE using the Nordic Uart Service.
