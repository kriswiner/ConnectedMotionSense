Simples Katydid sketck to blink the led once per second, output status of the MCU (MCU temperature, analog VDDA reference voltage, USB connected) as well as battery voltage on RTC alarm and otherwise remain in lowest pwer state. 
Good test of proper Arduino IDE set up and basic operation of the STM32WB55 MCU and Katydid platform.
